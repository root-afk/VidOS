Source and licencing info for the third party packages constituting VidOS
and its components have been collected here either manually or using buildroot's
native "make legal-info" target.
Source and licencing info for the toolchain was impractical to collect
here, but is availaible at: https://toolchains.bootlin.com/.
Please enjoy.
